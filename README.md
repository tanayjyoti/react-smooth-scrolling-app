# This is a Financial website using React and Styled Components.
    This app is just containes the homepage of a hypothetical Financial site. We have integrated smooth scrolling in this app with the 
help of the "react-scroll" package. So, when the user clicks on any of the links in the navbar, instead of navigating to a new page, the
home page itself will get scrolled down automatically to the section that corresponds to the clicked link. 

## Extra packages installed in this project---> 
    1. react-router-dom
    2. styled-components
    3. react-scroll
    4. react-icons
